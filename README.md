# OneSpan Sign Template Interface Exporter

## Description
This is a tool I wrote to handle exporting templates to and from OneSpan Sign accounts. It is written in C# and uses the Newton.json library to deal with JSON manipulation and the standard
HTTP Client to handle the RESTful requests. There is basic file encryption on the saved environment file which can be easily changed to match with any additional requirements. 

### NOTE:
The code is provided as is.
